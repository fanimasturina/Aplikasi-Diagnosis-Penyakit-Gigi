How to run the app on local:
1.	Download XAMPP, make sure the mySQL setting is on the way. (Turn on mysql and apache)
 
2.	import database on mySQL. Its name is "essks" (it is in this folder, in unzip first). The quickest way to open a database is to click "Admin" on the mysql section of XAMPP.
 
 
3.	open Visual Studio Code, then import this folder by "open folder" (not open file). 
 
4.	Then later appears the entire file in the left side corner (all assets will appear).
 
5.	In VSC, shift + ctrl + p, then type "Powershell Integrated Console". Make sure the Integrated Console, if not yet can be downloaded in the extension Visual Studio Code.
 
6.	Download virtual environment on terminal 
 
7.	Enter "python -m virtualenv venv" to create a virtual environment named venv
 
8.	Go to its virtual environment by typing "venv\Scripts\activate"
 

9.	After entering venv, install all requirements by typing "pip install -r requirements.txt"
 
10.	then click "python web.py" on the terminal to run its server. 
11.	If you are connected, open it in the web browser (Chrome) and click localhost or its IP name.
